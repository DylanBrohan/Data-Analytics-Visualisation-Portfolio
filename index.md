# Data Analytics / Visualisation

**Portfolio Summary**
During my final year of college I became fascinated with Data Analytics and Visualisation. As a result, I have created a portfolio style of some of the projects I have completed during and after my time in college. I hope to become more advanced with Visualisation tools such as Tableau, Data Desk and R. I aim to eventually get a position within a IT company where data analytics is a key factor and I can gain new skills and hone my own.

**The Data Visualisation Pieces were all developed using Tableau and its extensions.**

**All of the pieces demonstrated and coded were constructed using Excel Spread sheets of data or equivelant**
